# SLBR: Suck-Less Bilibili live Recorder

## Why another Bilibili livestream recorder?

Because **all** the other recorders are suck. So I write my own recorder, which, I hope, sucks less.

## Features

If you want a Bilibili recorder featured with:

- Single executable file, just copy and run
- Friendly command-line arguments and an optional configuration file
- Save raw video streams directly, without intentional clipping
- Efficient execution
- Friendly logging to `stdout` or files
- **Just works**

Then you should give SLBR *(suck-less bilibili live recorder)* a try.

## The project name is too offensive!

You can call it *Simple Lightweight Bilibili live Recorder*. It's all up to you.
