# YABR: Yet another Bilibili livestream recorder

## 1. Features

If you want a Bilibili recorder featured with:

- Single executable file, just copy and run
- Friendly command-line arguments and an optional configuration file
- Save raw video streams directly, without intentional clipping
- Efficient execution
- Friendly logging to `stdout` or files

Then you should give YABR a try.

## 2. Why another Bilibili livestream recorder

The other recorder sucks. So I write my own recorder, which, I hope, sucks less.
